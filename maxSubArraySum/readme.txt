1. The code has been written in python3.
2. Keep the test file in the same folder as the file- groupAssignment1.py.
3. The main function contains two implementations: 
	a. Running all three algorithms for random arrays. The generateArrays() will generate random arrays for 100 to 900 by default. You may change it for 1000 to 9000(as required). You may comment this out at first.
	b. Running all three algorithms for test file. You will be able to test the mstest.txt file via this.
4. The code should run fine for all three algorithms in one go.
