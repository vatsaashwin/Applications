<p>It is important to know the infrastructure of AWS(<a title="Week 1: Overview" href="https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1759382/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=18884561" data-api-endpoint="https://oregonstate.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1759382/pages/week-1-overview" data-api-returntype="Page">MLO1</a>) as companies around the world are moving to a cloud-based infrastructure to increase agility, gain unlimited scalability, improve reliability and lower costs at the same time and AWS infrastructure helps achieve all of that. Let's dig a little deeper to know more about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure</span></h2>
<p>Let's start by watching the following video for an overview on the topic.</p>
<p>As you go through the video, do try to understand the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are Regions in AWS?</li>
<li>What do you mean by Availability Zones(AZs)?</li>
<li>What constitutes a single AZ?</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="" title="AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPis5mbM8c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPis5mbM8c8" data-api-returntype="Page">Click here.</a></p>
<p>The regions in AWS are basically geographical areas consisting of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones or AZs(typically 3). Each AZ can be multiple data centers, and at full scale can be hundreds of thousands of servers. AZs are physically separated by meaningful distance from each other but are interconnected with high bandwidth, low-latency networking.</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>Additional Resources</span></h2>
<p>You might find also find the following optional resources useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read about what <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/?nc2=h_ql_le" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud computing</a> actually is and what are its benefits.</li>
<li>Explore the AWS Infrastructure with <a href="https://www.infrastructure.aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interactive map</a>.</li>
<li>Have a look at the various <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge locations</a> around you and why there are so important for availability and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>Let's discuss what you've learnt</span></h2>
<p>Now that you are aware of the infrastructure of AWS, let's see if you can point find out the closest 'Regions' around your location and list their subsequent AZs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this exploration, record your observations for the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What are three geographically closest AWS regions you could find in the interactive map(given in additional resources)?</li>
<li>How many Availability Zones could find for that region?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in a few words describe how AWS achieves reliability and quickly recover from failures to meet business and customer demand.</p>
