<p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications(<a title="Week 1: Overview" href="https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1759382/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=18884561" data-api-endpoint="https://oregonstate.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1759382/pages/week-1-overview" data-api-returntype="Page">MLOs 2-4</a>). These services help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale. AWS is trusted by the largest enterprises and the hottest start-ups to power a wide variety of workloads including: web and mobile applications, game development, data processing and warehousing, storage, archive, and many others.</p>

<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>AWS Core Services</span></h2>
<p>Let's start by watching the <a title="https://acloud.guru/course/aws-technical-essentials/learn/95e5d783-2f9b-15d2-0a08-fba4abe13a00/e59f36e4-0a2e-fc2a-c96b-295436d65c75/watch" target="_blank" data-api-endpoint="https://acloud.guru/course/aws-technical-essentials/learn/95e5d783-2f9b-15d2-0a08-fba4abe13a00/e59f36e4-0a2e-fc2a-c96b-295436d65c75/watch" data-api-returntype="Page">video</a> for an overview on the topic. This is a four-part video lecture series to give you a 10,000ft overview of various services provided by AWS. At first, it may seem like a death by powerpoint. But remember, you only need to pay close attention to the following services(that doesn't mean you can sleep through the rest). Taking notes side by side is highly recommended.</p>
<p>As you go through the videos, do try to understand the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute:</strong> EC2, Lambda, Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> S3, Glacier, Snowball, EFS</li>
<li><strong>Databases:</strong> RDS, DynamoDB, Elasticache</li>
<li><strong>Networking &amp; Content Delivery:</strong> VPC, Route53, CloudFront</li>
<li><strong>Security, Identity &amp; Compliance:</strong> IAM, Certificate Manager, Inspector</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>Creating EC2 instance</span></h2>
<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Its inexpensive, easy to start, integrate, control, highly flexible and secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a simple step-by-step <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a> for you to create an instance using EC2. You would require to log-in to your free tier AWS account to get started. Follow along and submit the required screenshot in the exploration section below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>Additional Resources</span></h2>
<p>You might find also find the following optional resources useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read more about how the Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/?nc2=type_a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identity and Access Management</a> module works. IAM assists in creating roles and permissions. You can manage permissions in order to control which operations a user can perform.</li>
<li>More on DynamoDB: Create and query a NoSQL Table with Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/create-nosql-table/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DynamoDB</a>. In this 10-minute tutorial, you will learn how to create a table and perform insert, scan, delete operations on the table.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #dc4405; font-size: 18pt;"><span>Let's discuss what you've learnt</span></h2>
<p>Now that you are aware of the core sevices offered by the AWS, let's see how you think you can put them to use in your existing projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this exploration, record your answers for the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Which AWS services intrigued you the most and why? List at least 3-4 services discussed above.</li>
<li>Think about the projects you are working on/have worked on previously. Answer the following:
<ul>
<li>Have you ever used any of the cloud-based service before? It can be other than AWS. If yes, what did you use it for in your application?</li>
<li>Considering all the AWS services listed above, which ones do you think would be most beneficial for your current/existing project(s)? Which one you think would be most irrelevant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an EC2 instance using the above resources and attach a screenshot of the instance you created with the instance state displayed as 'running'. Make sure to terminate the instance once you have your screenshot. (You may post the picture on another server such as <a href="https://imgur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imgur</a> and just provide a link below.)</li>
</ul>
